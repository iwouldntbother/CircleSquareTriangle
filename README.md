# Circle Square Triangle

## Brief

[Copy of the brief](docs\IS_U7_21-22_CircleSquareTriangle.pdf)

> In the oldest writings and in rock inscriptions of early man/woman the &#9632; signifies
enclosure, of home, of settlement. The &#9679; is related to the divine: a simple &#9679; has,
since ancient times represented eternity, since it has no beginning or end. The &#9650;
it’s distinct structure means we find it in lots of complex structures and in many
mineral and vegetable forms and structures found in nature, ranging from the
clover to the oleander

— Bruno Munari, Square Circle Triangle, 1960.

>&#9679; &#9632; &#9650; is an investigation into how we translate form and meaning. The project
is made up of a series of workshops that explore an idea and theme responding
to each shape of these basic shapes the &#9679;, the &#9632; and the &#9650;. Based on these
workshops you will generate an outcome; the format, media or medium is up to
you. It could be coded, performed, printed, bound, filmed, interactive, etc. These
outcomes are to challenge the ideas and themes explored in the workshop.
You are to keep detailed records and reflections on all the work and workshops.
Essentially, the brief is to create your own brief in response to the ideas and
themes that we explore during the workshops.
